This project is a free initiative to create Arduino driver for BMP085 Digital Barometric Pressure sensor. The main goal is to provide a driver that simplifies the usage of this particular pressure sensor in Arduino projects. 
The BMP085 is a high-precision, ultra-low power barometric pressure sensor for use in advanced mobile applications. It offers superior performance with an absolute accuracy of down to 0.03 hPa and using very low power consumption down to 3 µA. 
Sensor key Features (from Bosch website): 
•Wide barometric pressure range •Flexible supply voltage •Ultra-low power consumption •Low noise measurement •Fully calibrated •Temperature measurement included •Digital two-wire I2C interface •Ultra-flat, small footprint ceramic package
